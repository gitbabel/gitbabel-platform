# gitbabel-platform

Welcome :tada: The community-core mono-repository for gitbabel infrastructure and appliances.

## Overview

gitBabel is a learning and collaboration platform built to foster inclusive knowledge transfer for technical teams.  If this is your first time here you should check us out at [gitbabel.com](https://www.gitbabel.com/) to learn more about our mission.

Our commitment to open-source is why we've created this repository, here you will find the various services and libraries to build and run your own learning platform.  Our stack is built on nodejs and uses some common packages: unifiedjs, remark, express, nextjs/tailwindcss.

__Requirements:__

- Nodejs `v12+`

## Getting Started

We are just getting started.  The initial project we are open-sourcing is our __Codex__ service which is our primary markdown processing agent.

Our work is tracked inside of this [project broard](https://github.com/orgs/gitbabel/projects/1) and you can see our current ADRs in `docs/adrs`.
