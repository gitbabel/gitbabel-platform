# Codex 

Our Topic Transform engine, meant to take documentation artifacts and convert them into Topics.  Currently built to process `markdown` files and convert them into object-buffers with enriched meta data.

Currently built fully on nodejs using unified/remark.

## Get Started

Best to place to start is to clone/install and run the tests, and look at them in `tests/`.

```shell
npm install
npm run test
```
